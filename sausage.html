<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This apple sausage stuffing is fantastic for Thanksgiving! It is very flavorful and fresh-tasting. This recipe will stuff a 10-pound turkey (which serves six) plus extra. I replaced the usual pork sausage with much healthier turkey sausage.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 ¾ cups cubed white bread</li> 

    <li>1 ½ cups cubed whole wheat bread</li>

    <li>1 pound ground turkey sausage</li>

    <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>

    <li>¾ cup chopped celery</li>

    <li>2 ½ teaspoons dried sage</li>

    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried rosemary</li>

    <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>

    <li>1 Golden Delicious apple, cored and chopped</li>

    <li>¾ cup dried cranberries</li>

    <li>⅓ cup minced fresh parsley</li>

    <li>1 cooked turkey liver, finely chopped</li>

    <li>¾ cup turkey stock</li>

    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted></li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    
    <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

    <li>Spread white and whole wheat bread cubes in a single layer on a large baking sheet.</li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until evenly toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer toasted bread cubes to a large bowl.</li>

    <li>Cook sausage and onions in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until evenly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add celery, sage, rosemary, and thyme; cook and stir until flavors blend, about 2 minutes.</li>

    <li>Pour sausage mixture over bread in bowl. Mix in chopped apple, dried cranberries, parsley, and liver. Drizzle with turkey stock and melted butter; mix lightly.</li>

    <li>Allow stuffing to cool completely before loosely stuffing a turkey.</li>
