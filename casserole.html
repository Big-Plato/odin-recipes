<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Unlike many sweet potato casseroles, this one is not too sweet. It smells so amazing, with subtly sweet potatoes accentuated with maple syrup and a pistachio topping. It's a wonderful combination of taste and textures.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 ½ pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
    <li>¼ cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>


</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with butter.</li>
    <li>Place sweet potato cubes into a large pot, cover with water, and add a large pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until a knife is easily inserted into a sweet potato cube, about 10 minutes. Drain well. Return to the pot and mash 2 tablespoons butter into sweet potatoes.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs, maple syrup, buttermilk, milk, vanilla extract, cayenne pepper, allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mash sweet potatoes into egg mixture, starting with 2 tablespoons of sweet potato mixture, until all sweet potatoes are incorporated. Transfer sweet potatoes into prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li>Mix pistachios, brown sugar, flour, and 1/4 cup melted butter together until completely mixed. Crumble topping evenly over top of sweet potatoes. Use the back of a fork to gently press pistachio mixture down onto sweet potatoes.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and casserole is set, 25 to 30 minutes. If desired, place under oven's broiler for 5 minutes to give topping a little more brown color. Let rest to cool slightly before serving, about 10 minutes</li>
